# Changelog

All notable changes to the **ColorPicker** will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0-dev.5] - November 5, 2020

* Added a feature on the wheel color picker that enables entry of a hex RGB value to select a color.
* API changes to support separate display of Material color name `showMaterialName` and selected color code `showColorCode`, plus defining their text styles `materialNameTextStyle` and `colorCodeTextStyle`.
* New API `showColorName` to display an English color name for any selected color, not just the Material color names or custom named color swatches. It has text style that can be defined as well `colorNameTextStyle`.
* New API `colorCodeIcon` that exposes the color code icon so it can be customized.
* New API `enableTooltips` to enable current and future tooltips used in the picker. Currently only the copy color code button has a tooltip.
* A new method was introduced in ColorTools called `nameThatColor(Color color)`. It returns a name for any color passed to it, only supports English names. It is based on a Dart port of http://chir.ag/projects/ntc.
* Updated the example.
* Documentation updates.

## [1.0.0-dev.4] - November 2, 2020

* Update to try to get the images to show up on pub.dev.
* Minor documentation corrections.

## [1.0.0-dev.3] - November 2, 2020

* Significant API name changes and cleanup. Decided to implement previously planned changes before the official release, even if it will also impact our own usage of the package when we move to using the published version.

## [1.0.0-dev.2] - October 30, 2020

* First release on pub.dev
