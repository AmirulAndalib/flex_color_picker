# Changelog

## [1.0.0-dev.3] - November 2, 2020

* Significant API name changes and cleanup. Decided to implement previously planned changes before the official release, even if it also will impact our own older usage of the package, when we move to using the published version as well.

## [1.0.0-dev.2] - October 30, 2020

* First release on pub.dev

## To do list

* Add tests for the ColorPicker and its supporting classes.
* Review and correct any initial documentation mistakes and typos.
* For the any color selector, add text input to select a known given color based on HEX code.
* Maybe: Add other types of "any" color selector.
* Maybe: Add a color selected with the any color selector to the custom colors section.
* Maybe: Store selected colors added to the custom colors section.
