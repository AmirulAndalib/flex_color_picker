# Changelog

All notable changes to the **FlexColorPicker** package will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.3] - December 22, 2020
* Fixed the faulty documentation and comment for showPickerDialog parameter insetPadding.
* Fixed the faulty default value for showPickerDialog parameter insetPadding, the new default
  value is the same as Flutter and Material default
  `EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 40.0, vertical: 24.0)`, as it should have been.
* Minor documentation style correction.

## [1.1.2] - December 5, 2020
* Temporary: The Wrap implementation for showing the color code and integer value was changed to a Row due to a regression in Flutter SDK causing a crash issue on channels dev and master when showing the ColorPicker in a Dialog. For more info see here: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/71687
When the issue is resolved, the implementation will be reverted back to a Wrap. Using a Wrap has the added benefit of breaking the color code display+input field, and the rarely used int value, into two rows in case a large font is used in a narrow view when they are both configured to be shown. The Row may overflow in some rare cases. If you do not plan to use the ColorPicker with channels and versions affected by the issue, you can still use the previous version 1.1.1 to keep using the Wrap implementation if you need it. With normal styling it is typically not needed.
* Fixed that the provided `TextStyle` via property `colorCodeTextStyle` was not also applied to the shown color integer value when `showColorValue` was set to `true`, as stated in API doc and intended.

## [1.1.1] - November 11, 2020
* Updated the example app and documentation. The update includes updated screen shots and updated animated gifs.
* Unit tests for ColorTools added, widget tests still pending for later updates.

## [1.1.0] - November 6, 2020
* New API: Added `showColorValue` to optionally display the int value of the selected color. This can be used to assist developers when they need to see or copy selected color values as int numbers.
* New APIs: Exposed previously missing static color names in the API for all the accent and B&W color names in `ColorTools`. All the color name values default to English color names, but can now be changed to translated strings to provide Material color names in other languages as well.
* Updated the live Web demo to demonstrate the `showColorValue` property.
* Example and documentation updated.

## [1.0.0] - November 5, 2020
* First official release.
* Example and documentation updated.
* Updated the live Web demo version to use the released package.
* New API: Added `shouldUpdate` to the color wheel picker, as a fix for an issue where black selection changed hue to red. This is a lower level API that is not needed unless you make your own picker from scratch, and you want to use the wheel picker in your own picker.
* Final API name tweaks before version 1.0.0 release:
* Renamed: API `createPrimaryColor` -> `createPrimarySwatch`
* Renamed: API `createAccentColor` -> `createAccentSwatch`
* Renamed: API `colorNameAndHexCode` -> `materialNameAndCode`
* Renamed: API `colorName` -> `materialName`
* Renamed: API `colorHexCode` -> `colorCode`

## [1.0.0-dev.5] - November 5, 2020

* Added a feature on the wheel color picker that enables entry of a hex RGB value to select a color.
* API changes to support separate display of Material color name `showMaterialName` and selected color code `showColorCode`, plus defining their text styles `materialNameTextStyle` and `colorCodeTextStyle`.
* New API `showColorName` to display an English color name for any selected color, not just the Material color names or custom named color swatches. It has text style that can be defined as well `colorNameTextStyle`.
* New API `colorCodeIcon` that exposes the color code copy icon, so it can be customized.
* New API `enableTooltips` to enable current and future tooltips used in the picker. Currently, only the copy color code button has a tooltip.
* A new method introduced in ColorTools called `nameThatColor(Color color)`. It returns a name for any color passed to it. Only supports English names. Based on a Dart port of http://chir.ag/projects/ntc, it contains 1566 colors and their names. It matches the given color to the closest similar color in the list and returns its name.
* Example and documentation updated.

## [1.0.0-dev.4] - November 2, 2020

* Update to try to get the images to show up on pub.dev.
* Minor documentation corrections.

## [1.0.0-dev.3] - November 2, 2020

* Significant API name changes and cleanup. Decided to implement previously planned changes before the official release, even if it will also impact our own usage of the package when we move to using the published version.

## [1.0.0-dev.2] - October 30, 2020

* First development pre-release on pub.dev.
