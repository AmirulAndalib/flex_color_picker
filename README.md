# Flex ColorPicker

Flex ColorPicker is a customizable color picker for Flutter. The `ColorPicker` can show six different types of color pickers, three of which are used for the standard Flutter Material colors and their shades. The size and style used for the pick items can be customized.

#### The different types of available pickers are

1. Material primary colors and its shades. `ColorPickerType.primary`
2. Material accent colors and its shades. `ColorPickerType.accent`
3. Both primary and accent colors and their shades, in the same color picker. `ColorPickerType.both`
4. Black and white colors, including near black and near white shades. `ColorPickerType.bw`
5. Custom material like colors and their shades, that you define and name. `ColorPickerType.custom`
6. HSV color wheel picker, that allows you to select or enter any color. `ColorPickerType.wheel`

When you show more than one color picker, a segmented sliding control allows you to select which one to use. You can configure the `ColorPicker` to include any of the above color pickers. Showing pickers 1 and 2, together with picker 3 is not very useful, they are available as optional ways of showing and selecting the standard Material primary and accent colors.

Give the color picker a heading and a subheading for the color shades, typically Text widgets with appropriate style. Decide if the Material shades can be selected or not and if the selected color names and values are visible in the picker. If the color HEX RGB code is visible, the picker includes a button that allows you to copy the selected color code to the clipboard.

The shape, size and spacing of the color picker items can be modified. There is a built-in dialog that can be used to show and use the `ColorPicker` in a pre-made dialog. You can of course also make your own dialog and just use the color picker widget in your custom dialog.

## Getting Started

In the `pubspec.yaml` of your **Flutter** project, add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  flex_color_picker:
```

In your library file add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:flex_color_picker/flex_color_picker.dart';
```

### Example Application

To try a basic example of the ColorPicker on a device or simulator, clone the flex color picker repository and run the example:

```bash
cd example/
flutter run --release
```

The result is a default color picker with only the primary and accent color pickers available. Plus another picker that opens up in a dialog, with all pickers enabled, except 3 `ColorPickerType.both` and 4 `ColorPickerType.bw`.

### [Live Web Example](https://rydmike.com/democolorpicker)

You can also try a live web example of the [ColorPicker here](https://rydmike.com/democolorpicker). With the web demo you can modify many of the ColorPicker's API values and use it as a tool to find a style that fits your application.

The source code for the Web demo, which is a slightly more elaborate example than the basic sample bundled with the package, is available separately [here](https://github.com/rydmike/color_picker_demo).

## Introduction to the ColorPicker

As an introduction to the ColorPicker we will go through the example application. The example uses a StatefulWidget where we define a `Color` variable and give it a start value in the `StatefulWidget`'s `initState()`.

```dart
class _ColorPickerPageState extends State<ColorPickerPage> {
  Color screenPickerColor;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  screenPickerColor = Colors.blue;
}
```

Add the `ColorPicker` to the build method, could for example be in a `ListView` or `Column`. Give it the defined starting color, a `heading` and `subHeading`, plus the required `onColorChanged` callback function. Use the color from the callback in a `setState()` to modify the `screenPickerColor` to the color value returned by the callback. The callback in the ColorPicker is called whenever you select a new color in the `ColorPicker`.

```dart
ColorPicker(
  color: screenPickerColor,
  onColorChanged: (Color color) =>
    setState(() => screenPickerColor = color),
  heading: Text(
    'Select color',
    style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline5,
  ),
  subheading: Text(
    'Select color shade',
    style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.subtitle1,
  ),
),
```

The result will look like this:

<img src="https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_picker/blob/master/resources/ColorPicker01.png?raw=true" alt="ColorPicker default" width="300"/>

Change the pick item style, by giving it a defined size and let's make it circular:

```dart
ColorPicker(
  color: screenPickerColor,
  onColorChanged: (Color color) =>
    setState(() => screenPickerColor = color),
  width: 44,
  height: 44,
  borderRadius: 22,
 :
),
```

You can use same the `ColorIndicator` Widget that the `ColorPicker` uses internally as a color indicator. Here we use it in a `ListTile` as its trailing property to show the selected color. The `ColorPicker` also includes `ColorTools`, a set of static helper functions, that you can use to display names of the standard material colors, and their shade index value, as well as an optional Flutter style Hex color code. Below we use `ColorTools.materialNameAndCode` in a `ListTile` `subtitle` property to describe the selected color. We show its Material color name and index and Flutter style HEX code. We also use `ColorTools.nameThatColor` function, that will name any provided color based on the closest matching color from a list consisting of 1566 named colors.

```dart
ListTile(
  title: const Text('Select color above to change this color'),
  subtitle: Text('${ColorTools.materialNameAndCode(screenPickerColor)} '
                 'aka ${ColorTools.nameThatColor(screenPickerColor)}'),
  trailing: ColorIndicator(
    width: 44,
    height: 44,
    borderRadius: 22,
    color: screenPickerColor,
  ),
),
```

This gives us round color pick items and an indicator for the selected color:

## ColorPicker as a Dialog

A common use case for a color picker is to show a color selection widget and allow the user to select a new color in a dialog. The `ColorPicker` comes with a built-in dialog that can be used for this. Alternatively you can use the `ColorPicker` widget to build your own dialog based on it.

For the dialog example we will show all the built in picker color selection options, except the combined primary and accent colors picker, and the black and white shades' picker. We add some custom colors for the **Custom** colors section of the `ColorPicker`.

First we define our custom colors and from our single color definitions we create primary and accent color swatches, by using `ColorTools.createPrimarySwatch` or `ColorTools.createAccentSwatch` for accent color swatches. We add these color swatches to a `ColorSwatch` Map, that we map to our own custom names for our custom color swatches. You don't have to use the `ColorTools` to create the color swatches from a given single color, you can just as well define and use your own custom hand tuned `ColorSwatch` swatches. The functions are convenient helpers that can make Material like color swatches from a single color.

```dart
  // Define custom colors. The 'guide' color values are from
  // https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-theme-creation
  static const Color guidePrimary = Color(0xFF6200EE);
  static const Color guidePrimaryVariant = Color(0xFF3700B3);
  static const Color guideSecondary = Color(0xFF03DAC6);
  static const Color guideSecondaryVariant = Color(0xFF018786);
  static const Color guideError = Color(0xFFB00020);
  static const Color guideErrorDark = Color(0xFFCF6679);
  static const Color blueBlues = Color(0xFF174378);

  // Make a custom color swatch to name map from the above custom colors.
  final Map<ColorSwatch<Object>, String> colorsNameMap =
      <ColorSwatch<Object>, String>{
    ColorTools.createPrimarySwatch(guidePrimary): 'Guide Purple',
    ColorTools.createPrimarySwatch(guidePrimaryVariant): 'Guide Purple Variant',
    ColorTools.createAccentSwatch(guideSecondary): 'Guide Teal',
    ColorTools.createAccentSwatch(guideSecondaryVariant): 'Guide Teal Variant',
    ColorTools.createPrimarySwatch(guideError): 'Guide Error',
    ColorTools.createPrimarySwatch(guideErrorDark): 'Guide Error Dark',
    ColorTools.createPrimarySwatch(blueBlues): 'Blue blues',
  };
```

Then add a variable for the dialog picked color `dialogPickerColor` and set a start value for it as well.

```dart
class _ColorPickerPageState extends State<ColorPickerPage> {
  Color screenPickerColor;
  Color dialogPickerColor;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  screenPickerColor = Colors.blue;
  dialogPickerColor = Colors.red;
}
```

We use another `ListTile` to display a `ColorIndicator`, that we style a bit differently for this example. We also use its `onSelect` callback to open a dialog with another `ColorPicker`. Before we open the dialog we store the current `dialogPickerColor`'s color value. This way we can restore this color value if the user cancels the dialog.

```dart
  ListTile(
    title: const Text('Click this color to change it in a dialog'),
    subtitle: Text(
      '${ColorTools.materialNameAndCode(dialogPickerColor, colorSwatchNameMap: colorsNameMap)} '
      'aka ${ColorTools.nameThatColor(dialogPickerColor)}',
    ),
    trailing: ColorIndicator(
      width: 44,
      height: 44,
      borderRadius: 4,
      color: dialogPickerColor,
      onSelect: () async {
        final Color colorBeforeDialog = dialogPickerColor;
        if (!(await colorPickerDialog())) {
          setState(() {
            dialogPickerColor = colorBeforeDialog;
          });
        }
      },
    ),
  ),
```

Create a method to show the dialog. The `colorPickerDialog` is an asynchronous bool function, that returns `true` if the user closed the dialog picker with the **Select** button. If **Cancel** was selected or user dismissed the dialog by clicking outside of it, `false` is returned.

The `pickerEnabled` takes a map with `ColorPickerType` enum keys to boolean values. The map defines which color pickers we want to enable and use in the `ColorPicker`. In the example below we included Material primary, accent colors, and the custom colors, plus the HSV color wheel that allows us to select any color. We did not include the picker that combines the primary and accent colors in the same picker, nor the black and white picker.


```dart
  Future<bool> colorPickerDialog() async {
    return ColorPicker(
      color: dialogPickerColor,
      onColorChanged: (Color color) =>
          setState(() => dialogPickerColor = color),
      width: 40,
      height: 40,
      borderRadius: 4,
      spacing: 6,
      runSpacing: 6,
      wheelDiameter: 160,
      heading: Text(
        'Select color',
        style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.subtitle1,
      ),
      subheading: Text(
        'Select color shade',
        style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.subtitle1,
      ),
      subWheelHeading: Text(
        'Selected color and its material like shades',
        style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.subtitle1,
      ),
      showMaterialName: true,
      showColorName: true,
      showColorCode: true,
      materialNameTextStyle: Theme.of(context).textTheme.caption,
      colorNameTextStyle: Theme.of(context).textTheme.caption,
      colorCodeTextStyle: Theme.of(context).textTheme.caption,
      pickersEnabled: const <ColorPickerType, bool>{
        ColorPickerType.both: false,
        ColorPickerType.primary: true,
        ColorPickerType.accent: true,
        ColorPickerType.bw: false,
        ColorPickerType.custom: true,
        ColorPickerType.wheel: true,
      },
      customColorSwatchesAndNames: colorsNameMap,
    ).showPickerDialog(
      context,
      constraints:
          const BoxConstraints(minHeight: 450, minWidth: 400, maxWidth: 400),
    );
  }
```

The above example uses a few more styling properties, to make it more compact and to show the general color name as well as the HEX color code of the selected color in the dialog. With the color code indicator you can also copy the color code with the copy icon button. When the wheel picker is active you can enter RGB hex color, the wheel color indicators will then move to the color selection matching the entered HEX code.

Most importantly the above example uses the `showPickerDialog` method to show the defined `ColorPicker` in a pre-made dialog. The dialog needs a context, so we pass it along to it.

We also define size constraints for the dialog. If you do not define size constraints, it will auto size to fit the dialog content. Using constraints allows the dialog to keep the same size when the content size changes slightly as you switch between the different color selection tools you enabled. It looks better if the dialog size does not change when you switch picker type with the selector. The color wheel picker in particular will often require a bit more space. The wheel size can be customized as well, it does however become more difficult to operate if it is made very small. In this example it is on purposes of the lower side of still usable size.

The end result of the above setup is a `ListTile` where the trailing color indicator widget can be clicked to open a dialog to select a new color for the trailing `ColorIndicator` color.

As the `dialogPickerColor` color changes in the dialog, the `ColorIndicator`'s color also changes interactively. If the selection is cancelled, the `ColorIndicator`'s original color is restored.

As an extra exercise, and to better see this interactive change of the color when it is modified in the dialog, try connecting the `dialogPickerColor` value to the `AppBar`'s `backgroundColor` property. Did you manage to do it? What happened?

```dart
:
appBar: AppBar(
  backgroundColor: dialogPickerColor,
  elevation: 1,
  centerTitle: true,
  title: const Text('Color Picker Simple Demo'),
),
```

As can be seen below, now the selected color in the dialog changes the `AppBar`'s color as you select color in the dialog and cancelling it restores the `AppBar`'s color as well, **pretty cool!**

You can connect the color to theme colors and modify your application's theme color values interactively as well, but that goes beyond the scope of this example.

The example also includes a light and dark theme mode toggle, so you can test the look and operation of the color picker with a dark theme.

Flex ColorPicker works on all Flutter platforms, Android, iOS, Web, Windows, MacOS and Linux. Here is an example of the demo application running on Windows desktop.
