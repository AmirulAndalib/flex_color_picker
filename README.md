# ColorPicker

ColorPicker is a highly configurable color picker for Flutter. The ColorPicker can show anywhere
from 1 to 6 different color picking tools that you can use to choose colors from.

The different color selection choices are:

1. Material primary colors and its shades. `ColorPickerSwatch.material`
2. Material accent colors and its shades. `ColorPickerSwatch.accent`
3. Material primary and accent colors and their shades in the same color picker. `ColorPickerSwatch.both`
4. Black and White colors, including near black and near white shades. `ColorPickerSwatch.bw`
5. Custom material like colors and their shades, that you define and name. `ColorPickerSwatch.custom`
6. A HSV color wheel picker, that allows you to select any color. Material primary color like shades for the selected color are computed automatically. `ColorPickerSwatch.any`

When you show more than one color swatch selection tool, a slider allows you to select which one to use. You can configure the color picker to include any of the above color swatches. Showing options 1 and 2, together with option 3 is not very useful, they are available as optional ways of showing the Material primary and accent colors.

You provide the picker with its heading and sub heading, usually a Text widgets with appropriate style. You also define if the Material shades can be selected or not and if the selected color names and values are shown in the picker. If the value is shown, the picker includes a button that allows you the copy the selected color code to the clipboard.

The shape, size and spacing of the color picker items can be modified. There is built in dialog that can be used to show the ColorPicker in a pre-made dialog, but you can also make your own dialog and just use the ColorPicker in your own custom dialog. The example below show some variations of the ColorPicker.

## Getting Started

In the `pubspec.yaml` of your **Flutter** project, add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  color_picker:
```

In your library file add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:color_picker/color_picker.dart';
```

### Example Application

To try a basic example of the ColorPicker on a device or simulator, clone the ColorPicker repository and run the example:

```bash
cd example/
flutter run --release
```

The result is a basic default picker and another picker that opens in a dialog, with a few more options.

### Live Web Example

You can also try a live web example of the ColorPicker [here](https://rydmike.com/democolorpicker). With the web demo you can modify most of the ColorPicker's API values and use it as a tool to find settings and a style that you like and that fits your application.

The source code for the Web demo, which is just a slightly more elaborate example than the basic sample bundled with the package, is available [here](https://github.com/rydmike/color_picker_demo).

## Introduction to the ColorPicker

Define a `Color` variable and give it a start value in a normal `StatefulWidget`.

```dart
class _ColorPickerPageState extends State<ColorPickerPage> {
  Color screenPickerColor;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  screenPickerColor = Colors.blue[500];
}
```

Add the `ColorPicker` in your build method, could for example be in a `ListView` or `Column`. Give it the starting color, a `heading` and `subHeading`, plus the required `onColorChanged` callback function. Use the color from the callback in a `setState()` to modify the `screenPickerColor`, to the selected color in the color picker.

```dart
ColorPicker(
  color: screenPickerColor,
  onColorChanged: (Color color) =>
    setState(() => screenPickerColor = color),
  heading: Text(
    'Select color',
    style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.subtitle1,
  ),
  subHeading: Text(
    'Select color shade',
    style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.subtitle1,
  ),
),
```

The result will look like this:

![ColorPicker default](/resources/ColorPicker01.png)

If you like, you can change the pick item style and size. Let's make it circular:

```dart
ColorPicker(
  size: 44,
  borderRadius: 22,

  color: screenPickerColor,
  onColorChanged: (Color color) =>
    setState(() => screenPickerColor = color),
 :
),
```

You can use same the `ColorIndicator` Widget that the `ColorPicker` uses internally as a color indicator. Here we use it in a `ListTile` as its trailing property to show the selected color. The `ColorPicker` also includes `ColorTools` that you can use to display names of the standard material colors and their shade index value. Optionally it can also return a Flutter style Hex color code. We use it in the `ListTile` `subtitle` property to describe the selected color.

```dart
ListTile(
  title: const Text('Select color above to change this color'),
  subtitle: Text(
    ColorTools.colorNameAndHexCode(screenPickerColor),
  ),
  trailing: ColorIndicator(
    height: 44,
    width: 44,
    borderRadius: 22,
    color: screenPickerColor,
  ),
),
```

This setup results in round color pick items and a separate indicator for the selected color:

## ColorPicker as a Dialog

A common use case for a color picker is to show a color selection widget and allow the user to choose a new color in a dialog or cancel the color selection. The `ColorPicker` comes with a built in dialog that can be used for this. Alternatively you can just use the `ColorPicker` Widget to build your own dialog based on it.

For the dialog example we will show a few more of the built in picker options and also add some custom colors to the **Custom** colors section of the `ColorPicker`.

First we define custom colors and from the single color definitions we create primary and accent color swatches by using `ColorTools.createPrimaryColor` or alternatively `ColorTools.createAccentColor` for an accent color swatch of a defined color. We then add these color swatches to a `ColorSwatch` Map, that we map to our own custom names for the color swatches.

```dart
  // Define some custom colors.
  static const Color googlePrimary = Color(0xFF6200EE);
  static const Color googlePrimaryVariant = Color(0xFF3700B3);
  static const Color googleSecondary = Color(0xFF03DAC6);
  static const Color googleSecondaryVariant = Color(0xFF018786);
  static const Color googleError = Color(0xFFB00020);
  static const Color googleErrorDark = Color(0xFFCF6679);
  static const Color mrBlue = Color(0xFF174378);

  // Make a custom color swatch to name map from the above custom colors.
  final Map<ColorSwatch<Object>, String> colorsNameMap =
      <ColorSwatch<Object>, String>{
    ColorTools.createPrimaryColor(googlePrimary): 'G Purple',
    ColorTools.createPrimaryColor(googlePrimaryVariant): 'G Purple Variant',
    ColorTools.createAccentColor(googleSecondary): 'G Teal',
    ColorTools.createAccentColor(googleSecondaryVariant): 'G Teal Variant',
    ColorTools.createPrimaryColor(googleError): 'G Error',
    ColorTools.createPrimaryColor(googleErrorDark): 'G Error Dark',
    ColorTools.createPrimaryColor(mrBlue): 'MrBlue',
  };
```

We also create a `Map` from all the `ColorPickerSwatch` enum values to a boolean value, that defines which swatches we want to show in the `ColorPicker`. In the example below we includes material primary, accent and the above custom colors plus the HSV color wheel that allows us to select any color. We did not include the picker that combines the primary and accent colors in the same picker, nor do we show the black and white and its near black and near white shades picker.

```dart
  static final Map<ColorPickerSwatch, bool> swatchesAvailable =
      <ColorPickerSwatch, bool>{
    ColorPickerSwatch.both: false,
    ColorPickerSwatch.material: true,
    ColorPickerSwatch.accent: true,
    ColorPickerSwatch.bw: false,
    ColorPickerSwatch.custom: true,
    ColorPickerSwatch.any: true,
  };
```

We add a variable for a our dialog picked color `dialogPickerColor` and set a start value for it.

```dart
class _ColorPickerPageState extends State<ColorPickerPage> {
  Color screenPickerColor;
  Color dialogPickerColor;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  screenPickerColor = Colors.blue[500];
  dialogPickerColor = Colors.red[700];
}
```

We use another `ListTile` to display a `ColorIndicator`, that we style a bit differently in this case. We also use its `onSelect` callback to open a dialog with another `ColorPicker`. Before we open the dialog we store the current `dialogPickerColor` color that we intend to change with the dialog. This way we can restore this color value if the user cancels the dialog.

```dart
  ListTile(
    title: const Text('Click this color to change it in a dialog'),
    subtitle: Text(
      ColorTools.colorNameAndHexCode(
        dialogPickerColor,
        colorSwatchNameMap: colorsNameMap,
      ),
    ),
    trailing: ColorIndicator(
      height: 40,
      width: 40,
      borderRadius: 3,
      color: dialogPickerColor,
      onSelect: () async {
        final Color _colorBeforeDialog = dialogPickerColor;
        if (!(await colorPickerDialog())) {
          setState(() {
            dialogPickerColor = _colorBeforeDialog;
          });
        }
      },
    ),
  ),
```


The `colorPickerDialog` is an asynchronous boolean function, that returns `true` if the user closed the dialog picker with the **Select** button. If **Cancel** was selected or user dismissed the dialog by clicking outside of it, `false` is returned.

```dart
  Future<bool> colorPickerDialog() async {
    return ColorPicker(
      color: dialogPickerColor,
      onColorChanged: (Color color) =>
          setState(() => dialogPickerColor = color),
      showNameSelected: true,
      size: 40,
      borderRadius: 3,
      padding: 8,
      spacing: 3,
      runSpacing: 3,
      heading: Text(
        'Select color',
        style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.subtitle1,
      ),
      subHeading: Text(
        'Select color shade',
        style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.subtitle1,
      ),
      subWheelHeading: Text(
        'Selected color and its material like shades',
        style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.subtitle1,
      ),
      swatchAvailable: swatchesAvailable,
      colorSwatchNameMap: colorsNameMap,
    ).showPickerDialog(
      context,
      constraints:
          const BoxConstraints(minHeight: 475, minWidth: 480, maxWidth: 480),
    );
  }
```

The above example uses a few more styling properties, but most importantly it uses the `showPickerDialog` method to show the defined `ColorPicker` in a dialog. The dialog needs a context, so we pass it along to it.

We also define size constraints for the dialog. If you do not define size constraints, it will auto size to fit the dialog content. Using constraints allows the dialog to keep the same size when the content size changes slightly as you switch between the different picker types you enabled. It looks better if the dialog size does not change when you switch picker type with the selector. The color wheel picker in particular will often require a bit more space. The wheel size can be customized as well, it does however become more difficult to operate with touch and less accurate if it is made very small.

The end result of the above setup is a `ListTile` where the trailing color indicator widget can be clicked to open a dialog to select a new color for the trailing `ColorIndicator` color.

As the `dialogPickerColor` color is changed in the dialog, the `ColorIndicator`'s color also changes interactively. If the selection is cancelled the `ColorIndicator` original color is restored.

![ColorPicker dialog demo](/resources/ColorPickerSimpleDemo.gif)

As an extra exercise, try connecting the `dialogPickerColor` value the `AppBar`'s `backgroundColor` property. Did you manage to do it? What happened?

```dart
:
appBar: AppBar(
  backgroundColor: dialogPickerColor,
  elevation: 1,
  centerTitle: true,
  title: const Text('Color Picker Simple Demo'),
),
```

As can be seen below, now the selected color in the dialog changes the `AppBar`'s color as you select color in the dialog and cancelling it restores the app bar color as well, **Pretty cool!**

You can connect the color to theme colors and modify your application's theme color values interactively as well, but that goes beyond the scope of this example.
